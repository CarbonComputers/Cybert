To flash the firmware, connect the **bottom USB-C port** of the Cybert to your computer. After a moment, a new storage device named **“RP2040”** should appear.

Drag and drop the `.uf2` firmware file onto that drive. The RP2040 will automatically reboot and flash the firmware. Keep it connected for about 5 seconds to complete the process.

Once finished, test the keyboard and touchpad—moving your finger on the touchpad should move the cursor on your computer.
